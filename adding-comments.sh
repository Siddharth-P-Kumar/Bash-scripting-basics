7) How do you add comments to a shell script?
Comments in shell scripting are used to provide explanations or context to the code. They are ignored by the interpreter and are only meant for humans reading the script. You can add comments using the # symbol.

#!/bin/bash
# This is a comment explaining the purpose of the script
echo "gfg"
