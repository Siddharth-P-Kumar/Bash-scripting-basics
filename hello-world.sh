1) What does the shebang (#!) at the beginning of a shell script indicate?
The shebang (#!) at the beginning of a script indicates the interpreter that should be used to execute the script. It tells the system which shell or interpreter should interpret the script's commands.

For example: Suppose we have a script named myscript.sh written in the Bash shell:

shebang

The #!/bin/bash at the beginning of the script indicates that the script should be interpreted using the Bash shell.
The echo commands are used to print messages to the terminal.
